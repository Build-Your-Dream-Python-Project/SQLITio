#Here is how SQLITio works:
It makes a .sqlite file
every database splits into different pages, for example page001=Names
# This is the simplest way to intract with a database
The way that SQLITio works is very simple, your databases are files and you can easily move them anywhere you want and interact with them in the command line and the official python library

The code is written in python and it's efficient for small apps and software developed by python
